"""
 Matrix of dimensions higher than 2 are called tensors
 So far we have discussed 1D or 2D arrays that we call matrices
 but when we talk about higher dimension matrices in 3D, 4D...
 we call them tensors


 Though in machine learning you will mostly see 2D matrices,
 3D matrices or tensors are used in things like image processing
 , video processing etc.

 Conceptually there is no difference between a matrix and a tensor,
 you can transpose them, multiply them with some other tensors or scalars, and so on.
